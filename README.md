# SE-summative-1
Repo for SE summative assignment 1

For this project I will develop a simple JavaScript app that could be used within my workplace. My organisation is in the medical field and my chosen application is a simple calculator that can be used by healthcare professionals to estimate which sized implants will be required for a surgery given some simple patient information (age, sex, height, weight). The full algorithm used to perform such estimations is currently presented as an API and integrated to various digital solutions that the company offers. However, this app is intended as a lightweight and quick tool that surgeons can use when initially planning sugeries before requiring detailed MRI scans and other detailed measurements.   


Describe approach to prototype design
When prototyping this design Figma was used to draft a simple, single page form that can be used to enter patient information and perform the necessary calculations to return the estimated implant size. The prototype styling was designed to align to company branding and was shared with multiple end users to collect initial feedback. Alterations were then made to the design ahead of development.  


Project planning technique: Agile, 1 week sprints, use of Github projects, 
--addition of tickets/issues, to define product requirements
Throughout the design process an agile approach to development was taken. To align with course deadlines 3 one week sprints were planned. Week 1 focused on prototype design, set up of repository and preparation of initial backlog issues. During this sprint the project set up was completed, producing 

Build process: use of git pull requests, management of code

Test process: How is testing (CI) built into deployment, 

Evaluate the design
